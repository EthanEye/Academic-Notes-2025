# Counting 9.4

## **<ins>R-permutations:</ins>** A sequence of r items with no repetitions, all taken from the same set.

Ex: Consider the set X = {John, Paul, George, Ringo}. The sequences (Paul, Ringo, John) and (John, George, Paul) are both examples of 3 perutations over X. In a sequence, order matters so the sequence (Paul, Ringo, John) is different from the sequence (Ringo, Paul, John).

### Fact 9.4.1: The number of r-permutatiosn from a set of n elements.

Let r and n be positive integers with r <= n. The number of r-permutations from a set with n elements is denoted by P(n,r).

> P(n,r) = n! / (n-r)!

A manager has five different jobs that need to get done on a given day. The manager has eight employees whom she can assign to the jobs. A job only requires one employee, and no employee can be assigned more than one job. How many possible ways can the manager do the assignment?

Order the jobs arbitrarily so that one job is first, one is second, etc. An assignment is a 5-permutation from the set of eight employees. The first employee gets the first job, the second employee gets the second job,..., the fifth employee gets the fifth job. The 
5-permutation looks like:

> The number of 5-perumations from a set of 8 employees is P(8,5) = 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 = 6720
> (Also can be done by using generalized product rule).

Three dice are thrown: one red, one blue, and one green. Each die has six possible outcomes. How many outcomes are possible in which the three dice all show different numbers?
