## **<ins>Pigeonhole principle:</ins>** 

Says that if n + 1 pigeons are place in n boxes, then at least one box must contain more than one pigeon.

### Theorem 10.4.1: The pigeonhole principle If a function 𝑓 has a domain of size at least 𝑛 + 1 and a target of size at most 𝑛, where 𝑛 is a positive integer, then there are two elements in the domain that map to the same element in the target (that is, the function is not one-to-one).
