# Sequences 11.1

## **<ins>Sequence:</ins>** 

Is a special type of function in which the domain is a set of consecutive integers.

## Ex: The function 𝑔 is specified by the numerical values for the GPA in each year: 

𝑔⁡(1)=3.67,  𝑔⁡(2)=2.88,  𝑔⁡(3)=3.25,  𝑔⁡(4)=3.75


## When a function is specified as a sequence, using subscripts to denote the input to the function is more common, so 𝑔<sub>𝑘</sub> is used instead of 𝑔⁡(𝑘). A value 𝑔<sub>𝑘</sub> is called a term of a sequence, and 𝑘 is the index of 𝑔<sub>𝑘</sub>. 

The sequence is written:
𝑔<sub>1</sub> = 3.67,  𝑔<sub>2</sub> = 2.88,  𝑔<sub>3</sub> = 3.25,  𝑔<sub>4/sub> = 3.75

The entire sequence is denoted by {𝑔<sub>k</sub>} whereas 𝑔<sub>k</sub> (without the curly braces) is used to denote a single term in the sequence. While the first index is commonly 0 or 1, a sequence may start with any integer:

## A geometric sequence is a sequence of real numbers where each term after the initial term is found by taking the previous term and multiplying by a fixed number called the common ratio. A geometric sequence can be finite or infinite.

## An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of real numbers where each term after the initial term is found by taking the previous term and adding a fixed number called the common difference. An arithmetic sequence can be finite or infinite.
