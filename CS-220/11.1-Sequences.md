# Sequences 11.1

## **<ins>Sequence:</ins>** 

Is a special type of function in which the domain is a set of consecutive integers.

## Ex: The function 𝑔 is specified by the numerical values for the GPA in each year: 

𝑔⁡(1)=3.67,  𝑔⁡(2)=2.88,  𝑔⁡(3)=3.25,  𝑔⁡(4)=3.75


## When a function is specified as a sequence, using subscripts to denote the input to the function is more common, so 𝑔𝑘 is used instead of 𝑔⁡(𝑘). A value 𝑔𝑘 is called a term of a sequence, and 𝑘 is the index of 𝑔𝑘. 

The sequence is written:
𝑔<sub>1</sub>=3.67,  𝑔<sub>2</sub>=2.88,  𝑔3=3.25,  𝑔4=3.75
