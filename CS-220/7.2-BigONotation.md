# Big O Notation 7.2

## **<ins>Asymptotic growth:</ins>** 

Let f be a function that maps positive integers to nonnegative real numbers. The function f is a meassure of how fast the output f(n) grows as the input n grows. Asymptotic notation is a useful tool for evaluating the efficiency of algorithms. 

The classification of functions 

1. **Big-O (O)**
    - Upper bound on growth rate (worst case).
    - Ex: f(n) = O(n^2) means f(n) grows no faster than n^2

2. **Big-Omega (Ω)** 
    - Lower bound on growth rate (best case).
    - Ex: f(n) = Ω(n) means f(n) grows at least as fast as n

3. **Big-Theata (Θ)**
    -  Tight bound (both upper and lower).
    - Ex: f(n) = Θ(n^2) means f(n) grows exactly like n^2 up to constant factors.
