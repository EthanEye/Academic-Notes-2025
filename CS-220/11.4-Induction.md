Suppose that one day a genie grants Amal three wishes. Amal makes two wishes and then for his third wish, Amal wishes for three more wishes the next day. Given the fact that Amal can always use his third wish to renew his wishes for the next day, one can prove that from that first day onward, Amal can have three wishes every day for the rest of his life. This sequence of implications is an example of the principle of mathematical induction ( induction for short).

Induction is a proof technique that is useful for proving statements about elements in a sequence. An inductive proof establishes that some statement parameterized by 𝑛 is true, for any positive integer 𝑛. In the example with the three wishes, the sequence is the sequence of days after that first day of wishes. The fact being proven is that you are able to have three wishes on the 𝑛𝑡⁢ℎ day for 𝑛=1,2,…

Let 𝑆⁡(𝑛) be a statement parameterized by a positive integer 𝑛. Then 𝑆⁡(𝑛)is true for all positive integers 𝑛, if: 

1. 𝑆⁡(1)is true (the base case). 

2. For all 𝑘 ∈ ℤ+, 𝑆⁡(𝑘) implies 𝑆⁢(𝑘+1)(the inductive step).Means If k is true then the statement k+1 is also true;


# Base Case:

Establishes that the theorem is true for the first value in the sequence. (The genie grants Amal three wishes on day 1).

# Inductive step: 

Establishes if the theorem is true for k, then the theorem also hold for k + 1.(If Amal has three wishes on day k, then he can get 3 wishes for day k + 1).

# Principle of mathematical induction:

States that if the base case is true (for n = 1) and the inductive step is true, then the theorem holds for all positive integers.


## We’re proving that a statement (often involving a function or formula) is true for every number in a sequence. The inductive step is a compact way to state that an infinite sequence of implications are true.

For all 𝑘 ∈ ℤ + 𝑆⁡(𝑘) implies 𝑆⁢(𝑘+1) ↔ [𝑆⁡(1) implies 𝑆⁡(2)] and [𝑆⁡(2) implies 𝑆⁡(3)] and [𝑆⁡(3)implies 𝑆⁡(4)] and …

In the statement "𝑆⁡(𝑘) implies 𝑆⁢(𝑘+1)" of the inductive step, the supposition that 𝑆⁡(𝑘) is true is called the <ins>inductive hypothesis</ins>.
