# Counting 9.5

## **<ins>R-subset:</ins>** Sometimes refered to as a r combination. It is a subset of size r

# Counting the number of ways to elect the three representatives is the same as counting the number of different 3 subsets of students from a class of size 20

The term combination in counting is just another word for subset.

Regular parens (b,a) means the order matters and order matters in permutations not subsets {a,b}.

S = {a,b,c}

## How many 2 permutations from S are there: (You have a set of n distinct items and you want to select r items from it)

> P(n,r) n! / (n-r)! = 3! / 1! = 6

## How many different 2-subsets from S are there?

> {a,b} {a,c} {b,c} = 3
