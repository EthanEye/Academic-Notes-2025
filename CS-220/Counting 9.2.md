# Counting 9.2

## **<ins>The bijection rule:</ins>** Method of solving difficult counting problems by showing that the cardinality of the set to ve counted is equal to the cardinality of a set that is easy to count.

Ex: let S and T be two finite sets. If there is a bijection from S to T then |S| = |T|. Every person in a theater must submit a ticket to an usher in order to enter. One way to count the number of people in the theater is to count the number of tickets submitted. In this case, the bijection is from the set of submitted tickets to the set of people in the theater. Each ticket is mapped to the person who submits the ticket to the usher. The inverse function maps each person to a ticket.

Reminder: The powerset denoted P(X) is the set of all subsets of X. {0,1}^3 the super script here means Cartesian power or repeated concatenation in the context of strings. It means the set of all strings with length 3 of the alphabet.

> x= {a,b,c}
> P(x) = {Ø, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a,b}, {a,c}, {b,c}, {a,b,c}}
> {0,1}^3 = {000,100,010,001,110,101,011,111}
> f → |P(x)| = |{0,1}^3|
> f is the bijection between the set {a,b,c} and {0,1}

2^3 = 8 subsets for P(x) & {0,1}^3 also has 8 subsets (The cardinality of a power set is the number of subsets).
