How many different outfits does this give

6 x 10 = 60 unique outfits

**<ins>Enumerating:</ins>** listing out all elements of a set or a collection,
often in a specific order or for the purpose of counting.

**Express the set of all outfits as 𝑂 = { P (𝑝, 𝑠) ∶ 𝑝 ∈ 𝑃, 𝑠 ∈ 𝑆 } ,
where 𝑃 is the set of 6 pairs of pants and 𝑆 is the set of 10 shirts.
Note that 𝑂 = 𝑃 × 𝑆, and so from set theory we have 𝑂 = 𝑃 
𝑆 = 60.**

**Suppose you need to pick a password that has length 6-8 characters,
where each character is an uppercase letter. How many possible passwords

**How many license plates can be made which. Start with 2 or 3 uppercase
